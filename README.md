# ControlEngineering

This file includes codes and figures for the course Control Engineering of TU Delft, master of System and Control.

The object for control is the Bi-wing aircraft with a 3rd order transfer function. The control design of the bi-wing aircraft is divided into continuous-time control and discrete-time control.

The continuous-time control mainly focuses on the system's control in terms of reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Whereas discrete-time control mainly focuses on controlling the system in terms of state space representation.
